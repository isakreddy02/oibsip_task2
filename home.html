          <h3>Smart Traffic Control</h3>
          <p>As the population is increasing day by day there will be a need of transport to travel from one palce to another. And thus there is an increase in automobiles daily. As the vehicles are increasing there may be traffic jams. So as to reduce the taffic jams signals are arranged at the junctions. And those signals run according to the time span. And if there is no vehicles at one side of the road then humans should manually signal green to other road. But using this project there is no need of human intervention to make a decision to make the signal. Using cameras and machine learning algorithms this project auto detects the objects and generate a signal as a response. It saves a lot of time and also helpful to the people. </p>
